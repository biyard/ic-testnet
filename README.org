#+title: IC Testnet with Multiple Nodes

* Running ic-testnet
** Generating node configs
+ Firstly, set an alias =ic-testnet= for convenience.
+ Then, you can use =ic-testnet= as a binary.
#+begin_src sh
  alias ic-testnet="cargo run --bin ic-testnet --"
  ic-testnet ## It generates configs for 4 nodes
#+end_src

** Running replica
#+begin_src sh
  cd ic
  cargo run --bin ic-replica -- --config-file ../tmp/state-100/ic.json5
#+end_src

* Replica version
+ Replica version depends on the version of =ic= which is ported as submodule.
  + Currently, =0.9.0= is used as default replica verison.
